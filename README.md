librsvgdotnet
=============

A C# binding to librsvg using P/Invoke

This library is very loosely based on the following public domain code: (http://www.readingishard.com/2008/11/svg-tools/)

In order to use the library, you will need librsvg-2-2.dll and all of the requisite dependecies.

Two good places to find librsvg-2-2.dll and its dependencies are either a recent release of GIMP, or from Gnome's win32 releases: http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/librsvg/
